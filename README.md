# PokerMegabot_4000

In this project, an environment for playing poker is implemented, and a bot is written based on neural networks that can interact with this environment. The architecture of the bot is based on the application of transformers to a set of cards (the player's hand and the flop), a neural history compressor mechanism is also implemented to store the most informative hands of each opponent in memory. You can also play with bot via console commands and even train him by this games. 

The test.py file contains an example of starting a bot, all the necessary parameters are specified in the base_configs.yaml file.
